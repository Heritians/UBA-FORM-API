> Connecting Villages API serves as middleware for the frontend website and visualization dashboard.

## Features
### 1. Dump data
- The API dumps the data to the database by accepting the HTTP POST request from the client at the exposed endpoint.

### 2. Realtime Data Retrieval
- The API retrieves the data from the database by accepting the HTTP GET request from the client at the exposed endpoint enabling realtime analysis driven insights.

### 3. Visor
- The Visor offers a user interface for you to see a live view of all the events (logs). You can use it to debug your requests, test your endpoints by sending requests, and more.

### 4. Serverless FaaS Service
- This API is serverless and provides FaaS (Function as a Service) which means that you don't have to worry about managing servers, scaling, or paying for idle time that are managed by the cloud provider.

### 5. Custom JWT Authentication
- API is equipped with custom JWT authentication. All the protected routes are now injected with this custom JWT Bearer dependency.

### 6. Scoped Authorization
- Hierarchical scope of access applies a coherent authorization barrier to prevent unauthorized access. This ensures that only the required features are shown to a user with specific role and access to other sensitive information is not granted.
