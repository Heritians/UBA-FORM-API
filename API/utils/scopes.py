"""Decorator to apply scope related initial checks to ensure right
authorization barrier coherent to the 3-layered maintained hierarchy. Any
request made to secured endpoints will first be redirected here to perform
these checks.

Args:
    specs: Callable. A function performing Route-specific scope checks.

Possible kwargs:
    authorized_roles: List[str]. List of roles that have an authorized access
                                 to any particular routes.
    response_result: Optional[FrontendResponseModel]. Response model to pass to
                     custom exceptions unauthorized user tries to access the
                     endpoint to make appropriate changes in error messages and
                     status codes.
    village_name: Optional[str]. Name of the village if applicable.
    wrong_endpoint_roles: Optional[List[str]]. List of roles that have an
                          authorized access to but wrong endpoint access to
                          any particular route.

Raises:
    AuthorizationFailedException: If Wrong endpoint or unauthorized access.
    VillageNotFoundException: If queried village is not found in the database.
